Proposal: rename/migrate Client -> UserDetail (review before applying)

Summary:
- Current state: project contains both legacy Client repository/DTO/model under App\Repositories\Client and new UserDetail equivalents under App\Repositories\UserDetail. Model `App\Models\Client` currently extends `UserDetail` as compatibility.
- Goal: fully migrate all uses of "Client" (repositories, interfaces, DTOs, views, relations) to "UserDetail" and remove legacy Client files.

Planned automated steps (to be reviewed and applied in one PR):
1) Update namespaces/usages:
   - Replace occurrences of App\Repositories\Client\IClientRepository -> App\Repositories\UserDetail\IUserDetailRepository
   - Replace occurrences of App\Repositories\Client\ClientRepository -> App\Repositories\UserDetail\UserDetailRepository
   - Replace small DTO namespace App\Http\Dto\Client -> App\Http\Dto\UserDetail (or keep compat DTO that extends new one)
2) Update DI bindings in app/Providers/AppDependencyInjection.php (remove legacy bindings after confirm):
   - Remove binding of IClientRepository -> ClientRepository
   - Bind IClientRepository -> UserDetailRepository (optional transitional) then later remove
3) Update Models/relations/views:
   - Keep `App\Models\Client` as compat class (or remove after full migration)
   - Update `Auth::user()->client` usages to either keep (if Client model exists) or rename to `userDetail` + new accessor (requires view edits)
4) Update code references across `resources/views/`, `app/Services/`, `app/Repositories/`, tests, factories/seeders.
5) Run full test suite and fix issues.
6) Remove legacy files (app/Repositories/Client/*, app/Http/Dto/Client/*) once tests pass and code reviewed.

Suggested commands to apply changes (example Powershell script):
# run from repository root
# 1) create a branch for the refactor
git checkout -b refactor/rename-client-to-userdetail
# 2) perform replacements (review diffs before committing)
# Example using PowerShell -Simple replacements — run carefully and review
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Include *.php -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern "App\\Repositories\\Client" | ForEach-Object { $file=$_; (Get-Content $file.Path) -replace 'App\\Repositories\\Client', 'App\\Repositories\\UserDetail' | Set-Content $file.Path }
# 3) run tests
php artisan test
# 4) review, commit, push

Files likely to change (non-exhaustive):
- app/Repositories/Client/*
- app/Repositories/UserDetail/*
- app/Http/Dto/Client/* -> app/Http/Dto/UserDetail/*
- app/Models/Client.php (either delete after migration or keep as compat)
- resources/views/user/*.blade.php (uses $user->client)
- app/Providers/AppDependencyInjection.php
- storage/framework/views/* (clear and reoptimize)

Notes:
- I will NOT modify vendor files or generated files.
- Recommended workflow: I can prepare an automated patch and show the diff for your review (I will not apply destructive changes until you approve).

If you want, I can now:
A) Generate the automated patch (diff) for the rename and show it here for review.
B) Apply the rename automatically (risky) and run tests.
C) Do nothing further until you review the proposal.

Choose A, B or C.
